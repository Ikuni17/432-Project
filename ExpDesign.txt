When the time recorded for an operation is written to file it should be in the format:
<Load Factor>" "<Time Taken>"\n"
This can be read into Excel easily and we can plot load factor vs time taken

Loop through 5 or 10 times:
1. Generate a list of random integers (probably size 100,003)
2. Save input integers into a file in case needed later. (newline delimited)
3. Generate a perfect hash function
4. Loop through the random integers and record time taken for:
    4a. Inserting an element into the hash table (perfectHashInsertion.txt)
    4b. Looking up the same element (perfectHashLookup.txt)
5. Loop through the random intergers again and record time taken to delete each element (perfectHashDelete.txt)
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for Bin Hashing and then Cuckoo Hashing

Compile each method's operations in Excel

Additional things to consider:
1. Load factor at which the first element cannot be inserted for Bin/Cuckoo
2. Do we need to include the overhead of generating the perfect hash function?
    Otherwise it will be much better than the other methods easily.
3. What should maxLoop be? what did they use in the paper?
4. Keep track of successful/failed lookups/deletes?
5. They resize the tables if an insertion fails in the paper, should we? (For Cuckoo Hashing)
